title: Jelly, Roll!

<p>
	&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; For our final interactive computing project, my teammates and I wanted to explore a novel interaction with the Leap Motion Sensor. 
</p>
<p>
	Jelly, Roll! is a smooth scroller game controlled by the Leap Motion Sensor. The player takes the blob on a magic carpet ride by moving his/her to control the height of the platform. The ultimate goal is to make it through all three levels without falling off the platform and successfully guide the Jelly to the hospital!

	The Leap
</p>
<p> 
	We imported and used the LeapMotion library by Michael Heuer with Processing. Through a trial and error process working with the Leap Motion, the hand gestures that made it to our game have motions that are tightly coupled with thier functionalities. This was a design choice that we have never previously had to consider when building interactive works with the mouse and keyboard.

<p>
	We used Fisica, a Processing library that provides wrappers for Box 2D functions, to power our game. This wrapper library eased our attempt to embed properties like gravity, collision detection, and geometry into the objects.
